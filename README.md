This webpage contains a JavaScript program (programmed by me) which enables users to encipher and decipher secret messages using a secret key.
The particular method used makes this cipher very similar to the Vigenere cipher which was first published in Paris in 1586 in Blaise de Vigenere's Traict√© des chiffres.
The cipher is most secure when the key is random and has a character length on the order of the character length of the message.
